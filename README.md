# UE4 component-based interaction system with built-in replication
by doomtrinity

In this UE4 sample project you'll find a stripped-down version of the interaction system that we're using in the game Retchid.

It's a rather simple system, based on a custom interaction component with built-in replication, that can be used to handle the interaction with objects like buttons, levers, doors, etc.

You can dissect the project, you'll find the documentation in the source files. 

Tested on UE 4.22.3 and 4.26.1 (make sure to checkout the matching branch)
